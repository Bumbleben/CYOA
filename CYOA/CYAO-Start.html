	You wake up to flashing ligts and alarms.You're lying on the floor and a thick smoke is pouring from the vents. As you sit up, you see two dead crewmembers lying next to you. You look around and see that the smoke is coming from one end of the hallway, and you hear yelling. The other end seems safe and smoke free.
