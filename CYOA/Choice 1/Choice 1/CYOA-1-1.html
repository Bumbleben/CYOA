		<p>You stand up and get ready to go back into the smoke. You put your jacket back around your face, and Julie does the same. You start walking towards the smoke and it starts getting harder to see again. You move through the smoke bumping into things left and right. You hear Julie call out in pain and stop in your tracks. You move towards the sound of her voice. You finally get to her and getlow to the floor to get more air. Julie's unconcious and it looks like she tripped over something. You try go to pick her up again, but then you hear a beeping noise coming from a few feet away. You go towards it slowly and you see a dim screen. You see on the screen, flashing red text that reads "DAMAGE CRITICAL!" Suddenly you feel a violent pull and you get ripped through the airlock of compartment. You die. The End. </p>
