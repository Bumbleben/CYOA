	<p>You push yourself up, put your coat around your mouth, and start walking into the smoke. The smoke stings your eyes and it starts getting difficult to see. After about 40 feet, you see the outline of a woman on the floor. You kneeldown to feel her pulse. It's faint, but she's alive. You pick her up and carry her back into the hall. you lay her down on the floor and get an oxygen mask from a med kit on the wall. You put it over her mouth and after a minute, her eyes start to open. She slowly sits up and sees you standing near her. "Thank you captain!" She says. "You saved my life. My names Julie by the way." "Nice to meet you Julie. Just doing my duty." you say as cheesily as possible. She laughs then suddenly her face darkens. "What about the others?"</p>
